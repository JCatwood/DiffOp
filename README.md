## DiffOp

An R package that implements a flexible multivariate
  nonstationary cross-covariance function model based on the differential
  operators approach defined in 3-dimensional (3D) space. A defining
  feature of the model is that it can accommodate nonstationarity in the
  variances, colocated correlations, and other spatial features of a
  multivariate Gaussian random field, and is particularly flexible along
  the vertical dimension. With the implemented cross-covariance function
  model, users can simulate synthetic multivariate Gaussian random fields.
  Inference for model parameters is done via maximum likelihood estimation.
  Predictions at locations with no observations can also be performed.
